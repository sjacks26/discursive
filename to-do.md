I want to add a bit of code that creates a log file while a stream is open. It should have a standard name, and it should delete any file that exists with that name before it starts a new stream. In other words, it deletes old logs and creates a new log for each stream. The idea here is that I can see when a stream is functional (just waiting to complete) without having to wait for it to complete.
